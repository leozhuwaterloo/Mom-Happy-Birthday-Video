Q: I create cool animation, i want to render it with transparent background for using in Adobe Premiere / Sony Vegas
A: Background in all shapes transparent by default. If you want render with transparent and then import to other program you need to change settings in "Render Queue" window. Click on "Output Module", in opened window choose "Format - QuickTime", "Channels - RGB + Alpha", "Ok". After render you get *.mov file with Alpha channel.
